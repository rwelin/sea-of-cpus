Title: Sea-of-CPUs on an FPGA
Supervisor: Dr. D.B. Thomas.

This project concerns the design and implementation of a large, configurable
array of independent soft processors on an FPGA with inter-core communication.
The aim of this project is to create a general purpose CPU that utilizes the
dedicated logic, block RAMs, DSP slices of the target Xilinx FPGA well; to
create a scalable interface between the CPUs that allows for communication
between CPUs in different clock regions and to create an assembler in order to
more easily program the device. By designing a very regular instruction set
architecture which was greatly influenced by the target hardware, the resulting
micro-architecture implementation was small, yet powerful, and also allowed for
a very simple assembler. The inter-core communication was implemented using a
FIFO based approach which allowed for straight-forward configuration and high
bandwidth. The CPUs were tested using various programs, demonstrating good
functionality and performance with different topologies. In addition, possible
future improvements to the CPU are considered.
