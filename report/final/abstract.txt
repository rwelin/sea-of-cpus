Title: Sea-of-CPUs on an FPGA
Supervisor: Dr. Thomas,D.B.

This project concerns the design and implementation of a large, configurable
array of independent soft processors on an FPGA with inter-core communication.
The aim of this project is to create a general purpose CPU that utilizes the
dedicated logic, block RAMs, DSP slices of the target FPGA well; to create a
simple interface between CPUs that allows for communication between CPUs in
different clock regions and to create an assembler in order to more easily
program the device.
